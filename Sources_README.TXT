Below I will provide sources I used to learn and implement the genetic algorithim in IEEE citation and also a summary.

Google Developers VRP 
    Summary: 
    The webpage "Vehicle Routing Problem" provides instructions on how to solve the VRP 
    Example code is given in multiple lanuages Along with flowcharts and conceptual knowledge.
    There is OR tools which can help solve the problem which i did not use.

    IEEE Citation:
    [Authors's unknown], "Vehicle Routing Problem," Google Developers. Google, [Last Update 2023-01-16 UTC].
    [Online]. Available: https://developers.google.com/optimization/routing/vrp. [Accessed: 12-Feb-2024].

    
    What I gained From it:
    When researching VRP I had a good Idea of what I wanted to do but
    I needed some guidence on where to start and what it looks like visually. Since this site had the traveling salesmen Problem
    listed and I have experience in it I got to merge my previous knowledge and apply it to the problem provided by Vorto.
    Google has something call "OR tools" Which after some researching sounds like a tool that can help with a problem for instance VRP.
    I did not use these tools as I did not want to follow anyone elses code but It was nice having refrences from the page and since they talk about 
    genetic algorithim i was able to get more clarity on how to begin.



Simple Genetic Algorithm From Scratch in Python:

    Summary:
    The webpage "Simple Genetic Algorithm From Scratch in Python" by Jason Brownlee, published on October 12, 2021,
    on Machine Learning Mastery, provides a tutorial on implementing a simple genetic algorithm in Python. 
    The content covers the basics of genetic algorithms, their implementation, and an application example for optimization.

    IEEE Citation:

    12-Oct-2021. [Online]. Available: https://machinelearningmastery.com/simple-genetic-algorithm-from-scratch-in-python/.
    [Accessed: 12-Feb-2024].

    What I gained from it:
    I have done a similar problem to VRP in the past which is the traveling salesmen problem
    this follows the same concepts as VRP. I used this source after researching what algorithim should be
    used based on the constraints and evaluation metrics.
    I was able to gain enough conceptual knowledge from this post to set up my functions.



Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) - Example Hard Mixed-Integer Linear Programming MILP Problem:

    Summary:
    The video "Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) - Example Hard Mixed-Integer Linear Programming MILP Problem"
    shows an example instance of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) and how difficult it is to solve using a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)
     model. The Excel file used in this video is available at https://bit.ly/2lYEjVS.

    IEEE Citation:
    Youtube Author: DecisionMaking 101, "Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) - Example Hard Mixed-Integer Linear Programming MILP Problem," YouTube, Apr 6, 2020.
    [Video]. Available: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjyO0DK9Ys. [Accessed: 12-Feb-2024].

    What I gained from it:
    I was looking for a visual explanation of VRP and in a format that I am used to learning from.
    As I am a new grad I saught out a youtube video that can tech me.  
    The video gave mathmatical explanations and also visual tools that allowed me to follow what was going on
    I used this as I was pseudocoding so i could visualize what i needed to do to solve the problem.
